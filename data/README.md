Notes:
Mostly stratified subsamples of the above. But can also include samples from surveys, by-catch, etc.

-  F.G.: bio samples from NL between 1983-1994 were taken randomly and not length-stratified. It appears samples were taken when and if convenient for the samplers. EVB: These are not in the lf database, but are only composed out of ~40 fish, so also simply shouldn't be?
-  F.G.: 4X and 4Vn have few samples after 1983, when mackerel management was transferred from the maritimes to Quebec.
